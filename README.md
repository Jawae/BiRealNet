# BiRealNet
Implementation of Bi-Real-Net Model in Pytorch https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00278 



Below you can find pretrained weights on imagenet for full-precision bireal18 and bireal34 network.

Both networks are trained by setting initial `lr=1.0e-1`, `weight_decay=1e-4` and `momentum=0.9`. The learning reate is decayed everyting 30 epochs and trained for a total of 120 epochs.
